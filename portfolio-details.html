                            Fear? Not! Nation is a small, community-based charity supporting pediatric cancer patients and their families at 
                            Lurie Children’s Hospital in Chicago, Illinois. Our team applied a human-centered design process to help strengthen the
                            charity's presence through sustainable, responsive design, as well as equip its founder with a larger, more accessible
                            toolkit.This process included user testing, redesigning the organization's existing website, integrating existing social
                            media channels, and providing the founder with a design system and social outreach tools.

                        <h3>Project Background</h3>

                        <p>
                            Fear? Not! Nation is a small, community-based charity supporting pediatric cancer patients and their families at 
                            Lurie Children’s Hospital in Chicago, Illinois. Their primary forms of support include raising awareness around 
                            the hardships of pediatric cancer while fostering a supportive community through social media and providing 
                            their signature care packages known as ‘Fist Bumps’ to pediatric cancer patients themselves.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Fear? Not! Nation’s founder came to us with an open mind and a wide set of opportunities. She explained to our 
                            team the importance of relaying the true stories of pediatric cancer patients and their families and wanted a 
                            way to best tell these stories while increasing fundraising and potentially expanding the charity’s operations. 
                        </p>

                        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>

                        <p>
                            After assessing the charity’s existing website and social media channels, our team identified a number of opportunities 
                            we could tackle. The existing site had a number of flaws and limitations, such as the use of ambiguous language, incomplete 
                            and/or outdated pages and links, and overall non-responsivity. This led to our primary problem statement: <i>how might we 
                            restructure and refine the website’s information architecture and strategize the content in order to streamline user flow 
                            nd promote easy access to all salient information about the organization?</i>
                        </p>

                        <h3>Our Objectives</h3>

                        <ul class="objectives">
                            <li>Improve User Flow</li>
                            <li>Rework Information Architecture</li>
                            <li>Refine Content Structure</li>
                            <li>Create a Mobile-First Design</li>
                            <li>Integrate Social Media Content</li>
                            <li>Establish Brand Guidelines</li>
                            <li>Empower Creative Freedom</li>
                            <li>Ensure Low Maintenance</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Process & Methods</h3>

                        <p>
                            Our team employed a user-centered design methodology to address our problem statement. We broke our process into 
                            five main stages over the course of ten weeks: Discovery, Testing & Analysis, Design, Evaluation, and Implementation.
                        </p>

                        <h5 class="process-titles">Discovery</h5>

                        <p>
                            Our discovery phase consisted of conducting multiple sessions with our client in order to garner an understanding 
                            of the organization, its needs, and its primary users. In addition to these sessions, we compiled user data from FNN’s 
                            social media and their CMS analytics (Wix). The insights we gathered from our client meetings and user analytics contributed 
                            to our understanding of our target users. To ensure our understanding of the users and to synthesize our insights, we 
                            developed two personas to guide our research and design decisions:

                        <h5 class="process-titles">Design</h5>

                        <h5 class="process-titles">Evaluation</h5>

                        <h5 class="process-titles">Implementation</h5>

                        <h3>Retrospective</h3>

                        <p>
                            Initial contextual inquiry interviews with members of the Fear? Not! Nation community would have given us a richer insight 
                            into how their current users utilize the old site’s features. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Registering the foundation for a free Canva subscription sooner would have given us more time to familiarize our client with 
                            creating on-brand designs.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Greater team familiarity with Wix as a web development service would have allowed us to better understand how to make a 
                            fully-responsive site within Wix’s services. While the site is now mobile-friendly, which was our major goal, the desktop 
                            version is not responsive at all breakpoints.
                        </p>
