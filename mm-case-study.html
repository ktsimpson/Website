                            <h3>Project Background</h3>

                            <p>
                                This research project was conducted as part of a special topics course on Behavioral Science and UX as part of DePaul 
                                University’s Human-Computer Interaction master’s program. The project deliverables were the culmination of a three-month 
                                research project focusing on the domain of mental health, beginning with an initial question of behavioral change: how 
                                can we increase the uptake of mental health services? The proposed solution, MentalMatch, is a mid-fi prototype of a site 
                                designed to better support individuals in researching mental health care, from learning about the process of therapy to 
                                insurance coverage and potentially matching individuals with mental health professionals.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>

                            <p>
                                While strides have been made in increasing the accessibility of mental health services, such as the use of telehealth and 
                                virtual ‘therapeutic’ services (e.g., BetterHelp and Headspace), many barriers still exist in seeking treatment. Stigma 
                                surrounding mental health still persists, often resulting in delays in individuals seeking treatment which can further 
                                negatively impact their health. Additional systemic barriers, such as the cost of treatment and/or lack of health insurance 
                                can be significant factors in preventing individuals from seeking and receiving care.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Users & Stakeholders</h3>

                            <p>
                                This project’s original target audience were those whose mental wellbeing had been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
                                whether they were previously healthy, or had a history of mental illness and were experiencing relapses or exacerbated symptoms. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                As the project developed, we shifted our focus to any individual who had an existing mental illness, were beginning to exhibit 
                                symptoms of mental illness or distress, or simply those who felt they would benefit from receiving mental healthcare. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Additional stakeholders we considered throughout the project were healthcare professionals, such as therapists, psychiatrists, 
                                primary healthcare workers, and community healthcare workers. We also considered external influencers, such as friends and family, 
                                and health insurance companies as potential stakeholders.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Process & Methods</h3>

                            <p>
                                Our process began with a literature review that focused on a number of inquiry areas relating to mental health and the COVID-19 
                                pandemic, such as the burden of excessive virtual meetings, the effect of quarantine on interpersonal relationships, or the financial 
                                burden of mental health treatment amidst the pandemic and economic recession. Based on our initial research, our team created a 
                                research plan in order to better understand our audience and narrow our focus. We crafted four hypotheses to help guide our research:
                            </p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Increased education</b> surrounding mental health stigma will result in an <b>increase</b> in individuals seeking mental health 
                                    services because past research has demonstrated that educational interventions have been found to be effective in reducing 
                                    self-stigma in patients.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Individuals with <b>strong social support systems</b> are <b>more likely</b> to seek out mental health services than those without because 
                                    past research has indicated outcomes are determined by quality of responsive support and accessibility to interventions. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Individuals with <b>reduced structural barriers</b> will have <b>greater access</b> to mental healthcare services based on results from the National 
                                    Comorbidity Study and other studies on the correlation to cost, employment, insurance, and treatment for mental health. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    COVID-19 has helped <b>alleviate stigma</b> around seeking mental health services because a <b>larger number</b> of individuals are experiencing additional, 
                                    compounding stress, and seeking professional help.
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            <h5 class="process-titles">Methodology</h5>

                            <p>
                                We conducted eight interviews with both healthcare practitioners and individuals who reported being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and were interested in 
                                seeking support from a mental health professional. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The interviews were conducted remotely and lasted from 30 minutes to 1.5 hours. All interviews followed the same discussion guide and included cue cards as 
                                a research tool to assist participants in sharing their experiences. These cue cards noted potential <b>Influencers</b> and <b>Activities</b> the participant had engaged 
                                with as a coping mechanism during the COVID-19 pandemic.
                            </p>

                            <h5 class="process-titles">Findings</h5>

                            <p>
                                From our research interviews, we combined our data via affinity diagramming and found the four following themes:
                            </p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Lack of accessibility was identified as a barrier to seeking or participating in mental health services. This was predominantly characterized by either a lack 
                                    of insurance coverage or as an expensive, personal financial burden.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Another accessibility concern was that the process of finding a provider can be overwhelming and daunting. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Participants provided ideas around improving accessibility, such as free healthcare, additional virtual service offerings, or a way to collect and 
                                    display feedback on providers. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Public stigma is improving, but there appears to be a varying level of acceptance based on the perceived severity of the illness.
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>
                                These four themes allowed us to restructure our focus, shifting from looking at COVID-19’s impact on mental health to looking at the 
                                barriers in access mental health care in general.
                            </p>

                            <h5 class="process-titles">Frameworks for Understanding</h5>

                            <p>
                                Using the themes from our research, we crafted a behavioral archetype and associated journey map to further refine our focus.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Our initial journey map was reviewed by peer researchers, and we were given feedback on how to better depict key elements, 
                                such as our barriers, drivers, and inflection points. As well, we needed to better represent the possible cyclical nature of the 
                                upkeep stage. Our team iterated our journey map and developed a second version:
                            </p>

                            <!-- journey map 2 -->

                                Following the second iteration of our journey map, we were able to begin ideating a design strategy. We focused on what opportunity areas 
                                we could best address, and which key decisions the user needed to make that we could best attempt to leverage.
                            </p>

                                Following the creation of our design strategy, we prioritized the first stage of our journey—the discovery stage. As our focus narrowed down to how we could best 
                                increase transparency in accessing mental health services, we created a prototype that would inform and equip individuals about the process of identifying a therapist. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                We began our design process by performing a design charrette. We discussed and agreed upon a single design that combined like-ideas and adequately addressed 
                                the decision levers and concepts presented in our design strategy.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                We presented a mid-fi prototype of our solution, MentalMatch, to peer researchers and iterated on the design based on a series of design critiques. The old 
                                and new concepts can be compared in the carousels displayed below. The changes we made consisted of:
                            </p>

                            <ol class="ol-design">
                                <li>
                                    Home
                                    <p>
                                        Based on feedback, we altered our main navigation to use informational language, rather than directive. Additionally, we introduced an explanatory visual 
                                        to inform first-time visitors of how MentalMatch works to help lessen the overwhelm of the process.

                                    <p>
                                        We altered the layout of the page to better indicate the amount of information on the page. 
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                    <p>
                                        We opted to segment the support assessment questions into categories, with less questions and prompts shown per page to 
                                        help lessen overwhelm for users. 
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                        We added several options based on feedback: saving assessment results and the ability to retake the assessment. 
                                        We also added in additional design features to better display how the page would function to inform users of their 
                                        results and possible courses of action.
                                    </p>

                                        We added an additional page to display what users would see when exploring the informative glossary of therapy types.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
